5. Now type `update` in your **Anaconda Prompt**. It should start updating your app.

6. If the previous step has finished successfully, now type `refresh_data` in your **Anaconda Prompt**. The app should start downloading the data and update your database with the new joined dataset.

## Part 2 - download PDFs (optional)

1. Download PDFs from here: https://cbu-pdf.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pdf-prqst/pdf_proq.zip (45GB). Save the file in `pdf-library` folder (it's inside your `maas` folder). If you don't have enough space on your main drive, go directly to **Part 3**.

2. Unzip the files directly to the folder (options like `Extract Here` or `Wypakuj tutaj`).

3. After extracting, you can **delete** the zip file (`pdf.zip`).

3. **That's all!** üéâ Now you can type `maas` in your **Anaconda Prompt** and start using the app with updated PDFs.

## Part 3 - download PDFs to another location (optional)

1. Download PDFs from here: https://cbu-pdf.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pdf-prqst/pdf_proq.zip (45GB). Save the file in any convenient location.

5. Go to your `maas` folder. You should see another folder there called `app-data`. Inside `app-data` there's a file called `pdf-path.dat`.

6. Open `pdf-path.dat` with **Notepad** and overwrite its content. You can do it by selecting all (`Ctrl+A`) and pasting your PDF folder location (`Ctrl+V`). After pasting your folder location save the file (`Ctrl+S`).

7. **That's all!** üéâ Now you can type `maas` in your **Anaconda Prompt** and start using the app with updated PDFs.
