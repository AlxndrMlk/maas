4. Now you should see your **MAAS folder location** on the left of your cursor. If that's the case, continue üëçüèº

5. Now type `update` in your **Anaconda Prompt**. It should start updating your app.

6. If the previous step has finished successfully, now type `refresh_data` in your **Anaconda Prompt**. The app should start downloading the data and then update PDF information in your local database.

7. **Congrats!** We're done with the first part! üéâ Now we need to download the PDFs.

## Part 2 - download PDFs

1. Download PDFs from here: https://cbu-pdf.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pdf-prqst/pdf_proq.zip (45GB). Save the file in `pdf-library` folder (it's inside your `maas` folder).

2. Unzip the files directly to the folder (options like `Extract Here` or `Wypakuj tutaj`).

3. After extracting, you can **delete** the zip file (`pdf.zip`).

3. **That's all!** üéâ Now you can type `maas` in your **Anaconda Prompt** and start using the app with updated PDFs.
